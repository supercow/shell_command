Goals:
Replace all functionality of the Exec type
Should always work as expected within Puppet's dependency framework
  - Dependant resources should ALWAYS be unmanaged when the command fails
Adding providers for different shells should be trivial
Noop should allow for optionally skipping test commands
Should not cause problems with enumeration
