Requirements:

Replace all functionality of the Exec type
Should always work as expected within Puppet's dependency framework
  - Dependant resources should ALWAYS be unmanaged when the command fails
Adding providers for different shells should be trivial
Noop should allow for optionally skipping test commands
Should not cause problems with enumeration
  omitting the instances method should make this work
The type should not directly call any commands - only the provider
  Exec providers' run() is considered a violation of this

Problems:

How do you know if we're being refreshed or running normally?
  I might need a better understanding of the dependency tree
