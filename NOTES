Requirements:

Replace all functionality of the Exec type
Should always work as expected within Puppet's dependency framework
  - Dependant resources should ALWAYS be unmanaged when the command fails
Adding providers for different shells should be trivial
Noop should allow for optionally skipping test commands
Should not cause problems with enumeration
  omitting the instances method should make this work
The type should not directly call any commands - only the provider
  Exec providers' run() is considered a violation of this

Problems:

How do you know if we're being refreshed or running normally?
  I might need a better understanding of the dependency tree

  there is a method called matching_edges on the catalog...

  Puppet::Transaction::EventManager.queued_events
  now I just need to find the instance of this and see if the provider can access it.

  https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/lib/puppet/transaction.rb#L88
  that is where puppet processes events for a resource

  setting something in the refresh method won't work, exists? is always called before refresh
